#### DEPRECATED
This project is no longer maintained since an advanced implementation of this has been developed for Amethyst Grid.

# Flubbr
Flubbr, a flexible android plugin framework.<br>
Though still at a very young stage of development, the framework is capable of:<br>
1. Checking for installed plugins, and listing them on the basis of their intent action and category.<br>
2. Allow multiple plugins to bind to the host simultaneously, thus allowing them to run parallelly.<br><br>
As already said, it's at a very early stage, so needs some work before its good enough to be used for projects.
